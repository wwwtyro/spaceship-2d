    To get started, simply click the spaceship that is most attractive to you.<br><br>

    When you do so, a new set of ships will be generated from the ship you clicked,
    with their attributes altered a little bit from the original.<br><br>

    You can adjust the mutation rate for each generation by manipulating the sliders labelled
    "Base Color Mutation", "Detail Color Mutation", and "Shape Mutation". Play with these a bit
    to get a feel for how they affect following generations.<br><br>

    Once you've found a ship you like, hover over it with your mouse and click the
    save icon associated with it. A dialog will pop up, allowing you to adjust the resolution
    and number of siblings of this ship you want to save. If you save only one ship, it will
    be identical to the one you selected to save. If you elect to save multiple ships, the ship
    you selected will be saved along with mutated versions of that ship, where the mutation
    rate is determined by the settings described above.<br><br>

    When you click save, you'll be prompted for a filename. Here, you want to define where and with
    what prefix the files should be saved as. For example, If you select "/home/bob/ship" and are
    saving two ships, the following files will be created:<br><br>

    /home/bob/ship-color-0000.png<br>
    /home/bob/ship-normal-0000.png<br>
    /home/bob/ship-depth-0000.png<br>
    /home/bob/ship-position-0000.png<br>
    /home/bob/ship-color-0001.png<br>
    /home/bob/ship-normal-0001.png<br>
    /home/bob/ship-depth-0001.png<br>
    /home/bob/ship-position-0001.png<br><br>
