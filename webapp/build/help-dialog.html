    To get started, simply click the spaceship that is most attractive to you.<br><br>

    When you do so, a new set of ships will be generated from the ship you clicked,
    with their attributes altered a little bit from the original.<br><br>

    You can adjust the mutation rate for each generation by manipulating the sliders labelled
    "Base Color Mutation", "Detail Color Mutation", and "Shape Mutation". Play with these a bit
    to get a feel for how they affect following generations.<br><br>

    Once you've found a ship you like, hover over it with your mouse and click the
    save icon associated with it. A dialog will pop up, allowing you to adjust the resolution
    and right-click / save-as the images you want. The images currently provided are diffuse,
    normal, depth, and position.<br><br>

    It's a bit tedious to save lots of ships this way, so there's a desktop
    version of this tool that can manage that for you. Head over to the github repo for
    details:
